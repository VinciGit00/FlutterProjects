# Alingram

# Introduction

I don’t have Instagram and I don’t like it. Alin is a friend of mine who always travel and since I can’t watch his stories and posts I feel very ugly. So I decided to create a flutter web app for looking his IG profile.

## Requirements

The library required is webview_flutter: ^3.0.4 ([https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/webview_flutter)).

## How it Works

I use [https://www.picuki.com/](https://www.picuki.com/) to have the informations and posts of my friend’s profile and a webview in Flutter to see the profile by the app
